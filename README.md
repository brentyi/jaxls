**`jaxls`** is a library for nonlinear least squares in JAX.

We provide a factor graph interface for specifying and solving least squares
problems. We accelerate optimization by analyzing the structure of graphs:
repeated factor and variable types are vectorized, and the sparsity of adjacency
in the graph is translated into sparse matrix operations.

Currently supported:

- Automatic sparse Jacobians.
- Optimization on manifolds; SO(2), SO(3), SE(2), and SE(3) implementations
  included.
- Nonlinear solvers: Levenberg-Marquardt and Gauss-Newton.
- Direct linear solves via sparse Cholesky / CHOLMOD, on CPU.
- Iterative linear solves via Conjugate Gradient.
  - Preconditioning: block and point Jacobi.
  - Inexact Newton via Eisenstat-Walker.

Use cases are primarily in least squares problems that are inherently (1)
sparse and (2) inefficient to solve with gradient-based methods. These are
common in robotics.

For the first iteration of this library, written for
[IROS 2021](https://github.com/brentyi/dfgo), see
[jaxfg](https://github.com/brentyi/jaxfg). `jaxls` is a rewrite that aims to be
faster and easier to use. For additional references, see inspirations like
[GTSAM](https://gtsam.org/), [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/),
[minisam](https://github.com/dongjing3309/minisam),
[SwiftFusion](https://github.com/borglab/SwiftFusion),
[g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o).

### Installation

`jaxls` supports `python>=3.12`.

For Cholesky factorization via CHOLMOD, `scikit-sparse` requires SuiteSparse:

```bash
# Option 1: via conda.
conda install conda-forge::suitesparse
# Option 2: via apt.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libsuitesparse-dev
# Option 3: via brew.
brew install suite-sparse
```

Then, from your environment of choice:

```bash
# Option 1: from git.
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/brentyi/jaxls.git
# Option 2: editable.
git clone https://github.com/brentyi/jaxls.git
cd jaxls
pip install -e .
```

### Pose graph example

```python
import jaxls
import jaxlie
```

**Defining variables.** Each variable is given an integer ID. They don't need to
be contiguous.

```
pose_vars = [jaxls.SE2Var(0), jaxls.SE2Var(1)]
```

**Defining factors.** Factors are defined using a callable cost function and a
set of arguments.

```python
# Factors take two arguments:
# - A callable with signature `(jaxls.VarValues, *Args) -> jax.Array`.
# - A tuple of arguments: the type should be `tuple[*Args]`.
#
# All arguments should be PyTree structures. Variable types within the PyTree
# will be automatically detected.
factors = [
    # Cost on pose 0.
    jaxls.Factor(
        lambda vals, var, init: (vals[var] @ init.inverse()).log(),
        (pose_vars[0], jaxlie.SE2.from_xy_theta(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    ),
    # Cost on pose 1.
    jaxls.Factor(
        lambda vals, var, init: (vals[var] @ init.inverse()).log(),
        (pose_vars[1], jaxlie.SE2.from_xy_theta(2.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    ),
    # Cost between poses.
    jaxls.Factor(
        lambda vals, var0, var1, delta: (
            (vals[var0].inverse() @ vals[var1]) @ delta.inverse()
        ).log(),
        (pose_vars[0], pose_vars[1], jaxlie.SE2.from_xy_theta(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    ),
]
```

Factors with similar structure, like the first two in this example, will be
vectorized under-the-hood.

**Solving optimization problems.** We can set up the optimization problem, solve
it, and print the solutions:

```python
graph = jaxls.FactorGraph.make(factors, pose_vars)
solution = graph.solve()
print("All solutions", solution)
print("Pose 0", solution[pose_vars[0]])
print("Pose 1", solution[pose_vars[1]])
```

### Limitations

There are many practical features that we don't currently support:

- GPU accelerated Cholesky factorization. (for CHOLMOD we wrap [scikit-sparse](https://scikit-sparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which runs on CPU only)
- Covariance estimation / marginalization.
- Incremental solves.
- Analytical Jacobians.
